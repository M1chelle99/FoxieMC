# Contributing

### The way to contribute
To contribute to `FoxieMC`, please add a [Feature Request](https://github.com/mysticalfoxie/FoxieMC/issues/new?assignees=mysticalfoxie&labels=feature-request&projects=&template=feature-request.md&title=%5BFeature+Request%5D) at first.
There you can explain what you are willing to add. 

### Why so complicated
As owner of this mod I of course have some specific ideas where to go with this mod. 
For example a dragon would be a little unrelated to this mod... Which you will surely understand. 

So to contribute a feature to this mod, you first tell me with that Feature Request what you are thinking would be nice to add to the mod.
If I think the idea is nice, which I most likely approve, you can start coding. 
If not, I will explain detailed why this idea is not fitting for the mod. 

* **Advantage:** You do not work hard on some features, whose merge request doesnt get approved. 
  * You saved time and frustration if it doesnt get approved
  * You know for sure that your work is being added if it get's approved
  
* **Disadvantage:** You need to describe the feature at first... (and I know how annoying documentation is under devs ðŸ˜‰)

### Some final words
I hope this little barrier doesnt stop you from contributing. ðŸ’–

I wish for this mod to be a perfect match for not only me, but also the community. 

By contributing you really help this mod to come to a better experience for the minecraft community!
